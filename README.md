Ok everybody, new updates posted !
https://eejitgames.itch.io/santa - playable in the browser, with windows and android downloads as well !
For a quick'ish summary I would say that this is a light winter/christmas themed game.
I started out thinking about a strategy/gameplay style sort of like the old arcade game 'tapper', which would involve running Santa (not a bartender) around the place, and sort of maybe like Plants vs Zombies basically where the action sort of happens in lanes.
In my first prototype, Santa moved up and down the right hand side of the screen and threw gifts instead of mugs of root beer.
I paired up with Virtual Nomad to carry on with developing the code, the gifts were replaced with snowballs - and there were trees, elves, and bears oh my !
It has turned into what is a fun Christmas contest - you vs the bears !
Now Santa automatically throws cover fire for you, while you tap a lane to get an elf to dash out and grab a gift before the bear gets it.
Reach 25 gifts before they do - and you graduate to the next wave, how far can you get ?!
